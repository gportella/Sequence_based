Several tools dealing with NA sequence

Tools to 

- find RNA TFO binding sites in genomes, or predict putative RNA-DNA2 binding
regions in mRNA.

- Find approximate matches of a given sequence in a longer sequence 

Both codes depend on SeqAn libraries. TFO_finder also depends on RNAfold. 

All codes should be considered in alpha state.
